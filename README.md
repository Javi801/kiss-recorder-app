## Features

- **People management:** add, edit, delete people with attributes — name, birth year, zodiac sign, gender, activity, how you met
- **Event tracking:** log events with date, free-text details and an optional 1–5 score; edit or delete at any time
- **Analytics dashboard** with four tabs:
  - *Overview* — summary tiles and top-person highlights
  - *Time* — heatmap, area charts and monthly/yearly breakdowns
  - *People* — distributions by zodiac, gender, activity and age; age range boxplot with optional year split
  - *Scores* — score distribution, dumbbell chart and average trends
- **Zodiac-based age calculation:** age is derived from birth year and zodiac sign end date, so it increments on the zodiac birthday rather than a fixed calendar date
- **Age-at-event charts:** the "People by age" and "Age range" charts can switch between current age and the age each person had at the time of their events
- **PDF export** of the full stats dashboard
- **Localization:** English and Spanish
- **Local persistence** via browser/device storage (no backend required)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS) and npm
- For Android builds: Android Studio and Android SDK (Linux/Windows/macOS)

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at the address shown by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Production output goes to `dist/`.

### Icon generation

```bash
npm run gen:icon
```

Regenerates app icon assets from the source image via `scripts/generate-icon.mjs`.

## Testing

The project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with the V8 coverage provider.

### Running tests

```bash
# run all tests once
npm test

# watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npm run test:watch

# generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Coverage

Coverage is scoped to `src/lib/`. Minimum thresholds enforced by CI:

| Metric     | Threshold |
|------------|-----------|
| Statements | 95%       |
| Branches   | 90%       |
| Functions  | 95%       |
| Lines      | 95%       |

### What is tested

Unit tests live in `src/lib/__tests__/`:

| File              | What's covered |
|-------------------|----------------|
| `date.js`         | Date string validation, formatting, month/year/key extraction, zodiac date parsing, `calculateAge`, `calculateAgeAtEvent`, `deriveBirthYear` |
| `calendar.js`     | `parseCalendarDate`, `toCalendarDate`, `buildDayGrid`, `nextCalView` |
| `format.js`       | Score validation, kiss rendering, label translations, zodiac short labels, gender colors |
| `helpers.js`      | ID generation, people normalization, hex-to-RGB conversion |
| `stats.js`        | Event date helpers, all `getStatsData` aggregations |
| `constants.js`    | `abbreviateZodiacMonths` and related formatting helpers |
| `device-storage.js` | Storage read/write with mocked Capacitor/localStorage |

`pdf-export.js` is intentionally excluded (DOM + file system side effects).

## Capacitor / Mobile (Android)

The app is packaged with Capacitor 8. The web build output directory is `dist` as defined in `capacitor.config.json`.

```bash
# build web assets first
npm run build

# add the platform (only once)
npx cap add android

# sync web assets into the native project after web changes
npx cap sync android

# open in Android Studio
npx cap open android
```

For production builds, configure keystore signing in the Android project and declare any required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`.

### iOS notes and permissions

iOS builds require macOS and Xcode. If you add the iOS platform:

```bash
npx cap add ios
npx cap sync ios
npx cap open ios
```

If the app records audio, add a microphone usage description to `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Kiss Recorder needs microphone access to record audio for events.</string>
```

Ensure the Bundle Identifier in Xcode matches a provisioning profile and a signing team is selected.

## Data Model

```js
Person {
  id:         string
  name:       string
  birthYear:  number          // used with zodiacSign to derive current age
  zodiacSign: string          // e.g. "Aries (March 21 - April 19)"
  gender:     string
  activity:   string
  howWeMet:   string
  events:     Event[]
}

Event {
  id:      string
  date:    string        // format: "yyyy.MM.dd"
  details: string
  score:   number | null // 1–5, or null if unrated
}
```

Age is never stored directly on the person. It is computed at runtime via `calculateAge(birthYear, zodiacSign)`, which increments when the zodiac sign's end date passes each year. `calculateAgeAtEvent(birthYear, zodiacSign, eventDate)` is used in charts that display age as of the moment of each event.

## Troubleshooting

- If the native build can't find web assets, confirm you ran `npm run build` and then `npx cap sync <platform>`.
- For iOS build issues, check signing settings and valid provisioning profiles in Xcode.
- If audio recording fails on a device, verify the microphone permission was granted at runtime.
